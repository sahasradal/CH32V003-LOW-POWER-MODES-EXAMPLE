low power modes , sleep and standby
standby.S uses sleep mode to effect low power operation. PD0 is used as a switch and PD4 is connected to LED. The chip enters sleep mode and waits for interrupt. On pressing /shorting PD0 to ground the core awakes and lights the LED for 5 seconds and returns to sleep. standbyAWU & standbyAWU1 codes are to demonstrate WFE and WFI methods ( event driven and interrupt driven). No external signals are used. The LSI clock is used as wakeup source with 1 second interval. The core wakes up at 1 second ,flashes the led and then enters the standby mode . the above 2 code use PD4 to drive an LED, no inputs are used. I measured 300uA with a fluke multimeter when the PD4LED is off. My evaluation board has a power LED always on ,causing a higher draw in standby mode.
